# Globally-Optimized-Superword-LevelParallelism---LLVM


## Overview

This Project is an implementation of the paper GoSLP, originally created by Charith Mendis and Saman Amarasinghe.
This implementation was created as a final project for CSE 583 (Advanced Compilers) at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor

GoSLP aims to take a more optimized approach than the naive LLVM implementation.
